# Background
The primary objective of the study was to evaluate the effectiveness of Pymaceuticals key drugs. My responsibilities include generating all necessary tables and figures for the technical report of the clinical study.

Data Cleaning
- I began by loading and inspecting the dataset to understand its structure and content.
- I cleaned the data by checking for missing data, duplicated rows, and adjusting the dataframes accordingly.

Summary Statistics:
- I generated summary statistics for the dataset, including mean, median, variance, standard deviation, and SEM of the tumor volume for each drug regimen.
- I used groupby and aggregation methods to efficiently calculate these statistics.

Data Visualization:
- I created various types of plots, including bar plots, pie charts, and box plots using pandas and matplotlib

Outliers Detection:
- I identified potential outliers in the dataset by calculating the IQR and determining values outside the upper and lower bounds.

Correlation and Regression
- I calculated the correlation coefficient and established a linear regression model to analyze the relationship between mouse weight and the average tumor volume within the Capomulin treatment group
- I used these findings to quantitatively measure the strength and direction of the association between these two variables
